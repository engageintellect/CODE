     <h2>Getting Started...</h1>
   
     <p>
     First, you will need to have a genral understanding of coding. 
     But, contrary to what a lot of people believe, html is quite easy. 
     I have learned everything needed to code and serve this page simply by googling 
     around for answers. I am already starting to think of all the awesome stuff that could 
     be done with the skill of being able to make a simple web page from scratch. 
     Some of the things that come to mind are:
     </p>

     <p class="tab"style="font-size:16px;color:#909090">
        - Hosting a simple page or blog.(like this one)<br>
        - Hosting Photos and Videos.<br>
        - Serving files, documents, and backups.<br>
        - Hosting tutorials, code examples, and other learning materials<br>
        - Hosing personal project/file repositories<br>
      </p><br>
    
     <h2>Create a web-server in Go Lang:</h2>

     <p>
     Replace "static" with the directory that contains your webpage, images, and HTML code.
     You can also replace port number "3000" with whatever port you would like to use.
     Create a folder for your site and put this file inside of it. We're gonna name ours "static".
     </p><br>

     <h2>Coding the HTML:</h2>
     <p>
     Create a new file called "index.html". This file will go into the directory
     that we just created ("static"). You can use the template below to get started, 
     it will help you get used to working with the basic HTML tags.
